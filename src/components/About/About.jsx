 &nbsp;  We opened our restaurant in 2021 with the goal of bringing the flavors of Algeria to the world. Our home cuisine celebrates the diversity of Algerian culture through our delicious and authentic dishes.

Algeria is located in Northern Africa and has a long history spanning ancient civilizations like Carthage and decades as a French colony. This unique past is reflected in our menu, which combines Mediterranean, Arab and Berber influences. Our recipes have been handed down for generations and carefully preserved the traditional techniques and seasonal ingredients that give each dish its signature taste.

At Taste algeria, we strive to recreate the comfort and hospitality of an Algerian home. Stepping through our doors is like coming to visit family - you'll be greeted with warm smiles and treated to abundant platters of food meant for sharing. Our dining room has a relaxed, convivial energy as friends and neighbors catch up over meals.

Some of our most popular dishes include couscous, the national dish of Algeria made from semolina and perfectly fluffy steamed vegetables. We also serve a variety of flavorful tagines like chicken with preserved lemon and olives or lamb shoulder simmered with caramelized onions. For a taste of street food, try our chorba soup or seekh kebabs hot off the grill. And no meal is complete without a pot of rich mint tea to sip.

More than just a restaurant, we aim to give our customers an authentic cultural experience. So come relax with us - pull up a chair, pour yourself some tea and enjoy the tastes of Algeria. You'll leave feeling like you just spent the day with family.</div>
